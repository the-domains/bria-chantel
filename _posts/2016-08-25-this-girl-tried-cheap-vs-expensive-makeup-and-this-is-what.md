  When it comes to buying makeup products, many women believe that because a
  product is more expensive it's automatically better. Is this true, and do we
  really need to splurge on the pricier stuff? We here at Bright Side have
  decided to find an answer to this dilemma by comparing expensive makeup
  products to their very similar, but much cheaper, counterparts.
